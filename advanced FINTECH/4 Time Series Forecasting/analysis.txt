Analysis process: phase I: I selected the price of bitcoin for 70 days since February 18, 2022 to explore and study the factors of the war between Russia and Ukraine and the price changes of bulk commodities caused by them, as well as the price change mechanism of bitcoin caused by the price changes of bulk energy commodities such as energy, oil and natural gas. Phase II: Analysis: however, we can see that the price of bitcoin fluctuates around 37000-38000 within a period of 70 days, and there is no obvious upward or downward trend of price, which shows that the price changes of international crude oil, natural gas and other bulk energy commodities caused by the war between Russia and Ukraine will not directly affect the trading process and price changes of bitcoin.
